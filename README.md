Recently, I had the opportunity to attend an insightful Git training session organized by HotWax. The session was delivered by Mr. Shannee Ahirwar and provided a comprehensive, hands-on experience with Git.
Below are some of the crucial topics covered during the session:

1.Introduction to Git: Understanding the basics and importance of version control systems.
2.Git Installation and Setup: Step-by-step guide to installing Git and configuring essential settings.
3.Repository Management: Creating, cloning, and managing repositories.
4.Basic Commands: Fundamental commands like git init, git add, git commit, git status, and git log.
5.Branching and Merging: Working with branches, merging changes, and resolving conflicts.
6.Collaboration with Git: Using Git for collaborative development, including pushing, pulling, and fetching changes.
7.Remote Repositories: Setting up and managing remote repositories on platforms like GitHub.

The session was extremely beneficial and has greatly enhanced my understanding and proficiency with Git.
